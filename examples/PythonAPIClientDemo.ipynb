    "Civis Platform provides you with a Data Science API which gives you direct access to Civis Platform's cloud-based infrastructure, data science tools, and data. You can query large datasets, train a dozen models at once (and set them to re-train on a schedule), and create or update dashboards to show off your work. Using the Data Science API, you can write code in scripts or notebooks as if you're working on your laptop, but with all the resources of the Civis Platform.\n",

    "Civis Analytics provides [API clients](#what-is-an-api-client) for both Python and R. This notebook introduces you to the abstractions used in the [Civis Python API Client](https://civis-python.readthedocs.io/) and provides a few use examples. If you aren't running this notebook in the Civis Platform, follow the instructions in [Section A.3](#local-machine) for setup instructions.

    "This has been a whirlwind tour of the Civis Data Science API. Civis Platform has a lot more features than what we've covered here, such as sharing, enhancements, reports, and more. This tour gives you what you need to get started. Use the [API client documentation](https://civis-python.readthedocs.io) or the [API documentation](https://api.civisanalytics.com) to get a complete picture of everything the API can do, and contact support@civisanalytics.com if you run into trouble. The Civis Data Science API is a powerful toolbox that you can use to build, scale, and deploy your data science workflows!"

    "## A.1 What is an API client?\n",
    "\n",
    "API: Application Programming Interface\n",
    "* A set of tools for accessing Civis Platform functionality. An API is an official way for two pieces of code to talk to each other\n",
    "* Civis Platform itself works by issuing API calls, which are based on HTTP\n",
    "* But HTTP calls are unwieldy, so the API clients provide create a more streamlined way of making these requests\n",
    "* The API clients can be run interactively or in a script\n",
    "\n",
    "There are Civis API clients in Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you can do with an API client is supported by a Civis Data Science API Endpoint. You can find complete documentation on these endpoints here: https://api.civisanalytics.com\n",
    "\n",
    "####  RESTful API conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Civis Data Science API is \"RESTful\". That means it adheres to a set of conventions about the components of the API and their relationships. The world wide web uses REST conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API understands some basic HTTP \"verbs\":\n",
    "* GET →  Retrieve information on objects or members [get, list]\n",
    "* POST → Create a new item or entry in an item [create]\n",
    "* PUT → Replace something [update]\n",
    "* DELETE → Delete [delete]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  HTTP Status Codes\n",
    "When you send a request to an API, it will give you a status code. Common codes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 100-level codes: Informational\n",
    "* 200-level codes: Success\n",
    "    * 200 OK\n",
    "* 300-level codes: Redirection\n",
    "* 400-level codes: Client error\n",
    "    * 400 Bad request\n",
    "    * 401 Unauthorized (authentication failed) \n",
    "    * 403 Forbidden (similar to 401)\n",
    "    * 404 File not found\n",
    "    * 408 Request timeout\n",
    "    * 409 Conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict\n",
    "    * 429 Too many requests: You need to wait before you can use the API again\n",
    "* 500-level codes: Server error\n",
    "    * 500 Internal server error\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might see this error if you try to call a list endpoint with `page_num=0`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CivisAPIError: (400) invalid 'page_num' -1 - must be an integer greater than zero\n",
    "```\n",

    "The API client has translated the API's reply into a Python exception. The `Response` object for that error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'code': 400, \n",
    " 'error': 'invalid', \n",
    " 'errorDescription': \"invalid 'page_num' 0 - must be an integer greater than zero\"}\n",

    "## A.2 Rate limits and retries\n",
    "\n",
    "If you query the Civis Data Science API too frequently, Civis Platform may return a 429 error response, indicating that you need to wait a while before you can make another request. The Python API client will automatically wait and resend your request when your rate limit refreshes, so there's nothing for you to do. Be aware that too many requests too fast will make your code wait for a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the rate limit is 1000 requests per 5 minutes. You can check your rate limit by looking at the `Response.headers['X-RateLimit-Limit']` on any `Response` object that you get back. You can check out the `Response.calls_remaining` if you're curious how many API calls you have left before you get a time out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python API client will automatically retry on certain 500-level errors as well. That will give your code extra reliability when using the API client over the raw API. The full list of HTTP status codes which the client will retry are:"

    "To make requests to the Civis Data Science API, you will need an API key that is unique to you. To make an API key, navigate to your [platform profile page](https://platform.civisanalytics.com/users/profile) and create a new key using the panel on the lower right hand side. Set your key to expire after 30 days, which is the maximum currently available.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Python API client will look for your key in the environment variable CIVIS_API_KEY. To add the API key to your environment, copy the key you generated to your clipboard and follow the instructions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your API keys safe! Don’t check the key into GitHub or share in plaintext. If you do, immediately cancel the API key from the user profile page and contact support@civisanalytics.com .\n",
