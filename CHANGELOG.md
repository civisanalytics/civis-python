## 2.4.0 - 2024-11-11

### Added
- The new kwarg `retries` has been added to `civis.APIClient` so that
  a `tenacity.Retrying` instance can be provided to customize retries. (#495)
- Added `civis.workflows.validate_workflow_yaml`
  to validate a Civis Platform workflow YAML definition. (#497, #499)
- The helper I/O functions that create a Civis file
  (i.e., `civis.io.file_to_civis`, `civis.io.dataframe_to_file`, and `civis.io.json_to_file`)
  accept a new `description` keyword argument for the new `description` attribute
  of Civis file objects. (#498, #500)
- `Response` objects are now fully typed through the attribute syntax. (#501)
- Both `Response` and `PaginatedResponse` are now directly available under the `civis` namespace. (#501)
- Added support for Python 3.13. (#501)
- Added the new property `default_database_credential_id` at `civis.APIClient`,
  which is going to replace the existing `default_credential`. (#502)

### Changed
- When a `PaginatedResponse` object is returned from an API call,
  a user-specified `limit` kwarg is now honored to facilitate speeding up the pagination. (#501)

### Deprecated
- The method `get_database_credential_id` at `civis.APIClient` has been deprecated
  and will be removed at civis-python v3.0.0. There's no replacement for this method. (#502)
- The property `default_credential` at `civis.APIClient` has been deprecated
  and will be removed at civis-python v3.0.0,
  in favor of the new property `default_database_credential_id`. (#502)

### Removed
- Dropped support for Python 3.9. (#499)

### Fixed
- The repr form of `Response` objects is now the dict-based `Response({‘spam’: 123})`
  instead of the dataclass-based `Response(spam=123)`, since response object keys can
  be invalid Python identifiers. (#501)
- In `Response` object instantiation, object keys that originate from environment variables
  are now preserved for their (customarily upper-) case even in the default snake-case setting. (#501)
- In `Response` object instantiation, an API response that represents a JSONValue object
  now has its `value` attribute unmodified as the Python object representation
  of the deserialized JSON form (as opposed to being converted to a `Response`-based form). (#501)

## 2.3.0 - 2024-06-14

### Added
- Added a script for checking if the Civis API spec is up-to-date. (#489)
- Added a new keyword argument `sql_params_arguments` to the `civis.io.*` functions that
  accept a SQL query, so that the user can run a parameterized SQL script. (#493)

### Changed
- Refactored the `civis.parallel` module and related unit tests due to major changes
  of joblib from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0 (API-breaking changes for dropping
  `joblib.my_exceptions.TransportableException` and `joblib.format_stack.format_exc`,
  as well as the substantial changes to the internals of `joblib.Parallel`). (#488)
- Bumped the minimum required version of `joblib` to v1.3.0,
  which is the version where `joblib.parallel_config` was introduced and
  `joblib.parallel_backend` was deprecated. (#488)
- Improved the startup time of `import civis` with a 5x speed boost. (#490, #493)
- The downloaded API spec due to the `civis.APIClient` instantiation is now
  a time-to-live cache in memory (15 minutes for interactive Python, or 24 hours in scripts). (#491)
- Polling at `PollableResult` (and consequently its subclasses as well: `CivisFuture`,
  `ContainerFuture`, and `ModelFuture`) now defaults to geometrically increased polling
  intervals. Short-running jobs' `future.result()` can now return faster, while
  longer-running jobs have a capped polling interval of 15 seconds. (#492)
- Comparing a `Response` object with a non-`Response` object returns `False` now
  (this previously raised a `TypeError`). (#493)

### Fixed
- Fixed `civis.parallel.make_backend_template_factory` so that
  keyword arguments are now accepted and passed to `client.scripts.post_custom`. (#488)
- For `Response` objects, their "repr" form shows the class name "Response" for both
  top-level and nested response objects. (#493)

### Security
- Bumped the minimum required version of `requests` to the latest v2.32.3, 
  due to a security vulnerability for < v2.32.0
  ([CVE-2024-35195](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35195)). (#488)

## 2.2.0 - 2024-05-28

## Added
- `civis.response.Response` has its own "repr" and pretty-print format,
  instead of the previous dict-like representation that would incorrectly suggest immutability. (#487)
- Added the `--version` flag to the command line interface. (#487)

## Fixed
- Fixed API response objects' `.json()` for lists. (#487)
- Fixed `civis_logger` for always having the attribute `propagate` attribute set to `False`
  so that it can also be used for notebooks and services/apps on Civis Platform. (#487)

## 2.1.0 - 2024-05-23

### Added
- Added `.json()` at `civis.response.Response` to return the original JSON data from Civis API. (#486)

### Changed
- Updated the Civis API spec. (#486)

### Fixed
- Fixed `civis.response.Response` so that keys that shouldn't be mutated for casing,
  specifically those under `"arguments"`, are now kept unchanged. (#486)

## 2.0.0 - 2024-05-21

### Breaking Changes from v1.x.x to v2.0.0

(Changes documented in this section are not repeated in the following sections.)

- A `civis.response.Response` object is no longer mutable
  (implementationally, it subclassed `dict` before, which is no longer the case).
  More concretely, both the "setitem" (e.g., `response["foo"] = "bar"`)
  and "setattr" (e.g., `response.foo = "bar"`) operations
  would now raise an `CivisImmutableResponseError` exception. (#463)
- Instantiating a `civis.response.Response` object no longer
  accepts the boolean `snake_case` keyword argument;
  snake-case keys at a `Response` object are now always available (and preferred). (#463)
- Parameters for various classes/functions that have long been deprecated are removed:
  `api_key`, `resources`, `retry_total`, `archive`, `headers`.
  Also dropped the deprecated methods in `ServiceClient`. (#472)
- The `return_type` parameter of a `civis.response.Response` object
  no longer has the `"pandas"` option. (#473)
- When `civis.find` uses kwargs as filters, boolean values are now treated in the same
  way as other data types for value equality comparison, rather than the presence or
  absence of the key in question. (#474)
- To access the API endpoints "MatchTargets" and "RemoteHosts" via `client = civis.APIClient()`,
  `client.matchtargets` and `client.remotehosts` are no longer available.
  Only the names with underscores, i.e., `client.match_targets` and `client.remote_hosts`,
  can be used instead. (#479)

### Added
- Added error handling of file_id with type string passed to `civis.io.civis_file_to_table`. (#454)
- Added support for Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 (#462, #475)
- A `FutureWarning` is now raised when a deprecated Civis API endpoint method is called. (#477)
- Added `civis_logger` for logging in Civis Platform scripts. (#478)
- Added the stub file `client.pyi` to surface the API endpoints and their type annotations
  at a `civis.APIClient` instance to IDEs. (#479)
- Added the `job_url` property to `CivisFuture` objects. (#482)
- Added `.readthedocs.yaml` to configure the ReadTheDocs build. (#483)

### Changed
- Updated references from 'master' to 'main' (#460)
- Clarified the usage example for `civis.io.civis_to_multifile_csv`. Updated 
  CircleCI config so dev-requirements is only used when needed. (#452)
- Removed unneeded `time.sleep` calls and `pytest.mark` calls and mocked `time.sleep` calls to optimize tests. (#453)
- Refactored tests to remove dependency on the vcr library. (#456)
- Fixed typo in "Testing Your Code" example of the User Guide (#458)
- Adding `try`-`except` to catch `JSONDecodeErrors` in `CivisAPIError` (#459)
- `civis.io.file_id_from_run_output` now works for all job types (#461)
- A nested `civis.response.Response` object now supports both snake-case and camel-case
  for key access. Previously, only the non-Pythonic camel-case keys were available. (#463)
- Pinned the dependency `joblib` at `< 1.3.0`, since `joblib >= 1.3.0` is incompatible
  with the current civis-python codebase. (#469)
- Changed `civis.io.civis_file_to_table` to not rely on table IDs for determining a table's existence (#470)
- Broke out the "API Resources" documentation page into individual endpoint pages (#471)
- Switched to `pyproject.toml` for packaging. (#475)
- CI builds for Windows switched from AppVeyor to CircleCI. (#480)
- Applied the `black` code formatter to the codebase. (#481)

### Removed

  add "CIVIS_PARENT_JOB_ID" and "CIVIS_PARENT_RUN_ID" environment variables
  to the child jobs they create (#236)
- Update default CivisML version to v2.2. This includes a new function
  ``ModelPipeline.register_pretrained_model`` which allows users to train
  a model outside of Civis Platform and use CivisML to score it at scale (#242, #247).
- Added a new parameter ``dvs_to_predict`` to ``civis.ml.ModelPipeline.predict``.
  This allows users to select a subset of a model's outputs for scoring (#241).
- Added `civis.io.export_to_civis_file` to store results of a SQL query
  to a Civis file
- Surfaced `civis.find` and `civis.find_one` in the Sphinx docs. (#250)

## 1.8.1 - 2018-02-01
### Added
- Added a script for integration tests (smoke tests).

### Fixed
- Added missing string formatting to a log emit in file multipart upload and
  correct ordering of parameters in another log emit (#217)

### Changed
- Updated documentation with new information about predefined stacking
  estimators (#221)
- Updated CivisML 2.0 notebook (#214)
- Reworded output of `civis notebooks new` CLI command (#215)

## 1.8.0 - 2018-01-23
### Added
- Documentation updated to reflect CivisML 2.1 features (#209)
- ``civis.io.dataframe_to_civis``, ``civis.io.csv_to_civis``, and ``civis.io.civis_file_to_table`` functions now support the `diststyle` parameter.
- New notebook-related CLI commands: "new", "up", "down", and "open".
- Additional documentation for using the Civis joblib backend (#199)
- Documented additional soft dependencies for CivisML (#203)

### Changed
- Changed `ModelPipeline.train` default for `n_jobs` from 4 to `None`,
  so that `n_jobs` will be dynamically calculated by default (#203)
- Use "feather"-formatted files to send data from users to CivisML, if possible.
  Require this when using ``pd.Categorical`` types, since CSVs require us to
  re-infer column types, and this can fail. Using feather should also give a
  speed improvement; it reads and writes faster than CSVs and produces smaller files (#200).
- ``ModelFuture`` objects will emit any warnings which occurred during their
  corresponding CivisML job (#204)
- Removed line setting "n_jobs" from an example of CivisML prediction.
  Recommended use is to let CivisML determine the number of jobs itself (#211).
- Update maximum CivisML version to v2.1; adjust fallback logic such that users get
  the most recent available release (#212).

### Fixed
- Restored the pre-v1.7.0 default behavior of the ``joblib`` backend by setting the ``remote_backend``
  parameter default to 'sequential' as opposed to 'civis'. The default of 'civis' would launch additional
  containers in nested calls to ``joblib.Parallel``. (#205)
- If validation metadata are missing, ``ModelFuture`` objects will return ``None``
  for metrics or validation metadata, rather than issuing an exception (#208)
- Allowed callers to pass `index` and `encoding` arguments to the `to_csv` method through `dataframe_to_civis`.

### Performance Enhancements
- ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` now uses additional file handles for multipart upload instead of writing to disk to reduce disk usage
- ``civis.io.dataframe_to_civis`` writes dataframes to disk instead of using an in memory buffer

## 1.7.2 - 2018-01-09
### Fixed
- Relaxed requirement on ``cloudpickle`` version number (#187)
- Restore previous behavior of ``civis.io.civis_to_csv`` when using "compression='gzip'" (#195)

## 1.7.1 - 2017-11-16
### Fixed
- Specify escape character in ``civis.io.read_civis_sql`` when performing parallel unload
- Issue uploading files in ``civis.io.file_to_civis``
- Revert performance enhancement that will change format of file produced by ``civis.io.civis_to_csv``

## 1.7.0 - 2017-11-15
### Changed
- Updated CivisML template ids to v2.0 (#139)
- Optional arguments to API endpoints now display in function signatures.
  Function signatures show a default value of "DEFAULT"; arguments will still
  only be transmitted to the Civis Platform API when explicitly provided. (#140)
- ``APIClient.feature_flags`` has been deprecated to avoid a name collision
   with the feature_flags endpoint. In v2.0.0, ``APIClient.featureflags``
   will be renamed to ``APIClient.feature_flags``.
- The following APIClient attributes have been deprecated in favor of the
  attribute that includes underscores:
  ``APIClient.bocceclusters`` -> ``APIClient.bocce_clusters``
  ``APIClient.matchtargets`` -> ``APIClient.match_targets``
  ``APIClient.remotehosts`` -> ``APIClient.remote_hosts``
- ``civis.io.csv_to_civis`` and ``civis.io.dataframe_to_civis`` functions now use
  ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` and ``civis.io.civis_file_to_table`` functions instead
  of separate logic
- ``civis.io.file_to_civis``, ``civis.io.csv_to_civis`` and ``civis.io.dataframe_to_civis``
  now support files over 5GB
- Refactor internals of ``CivisFuture`` and ``PollableResult`` to centralize handling
  of threads and ``pubnub`` subscription.
- Updated API specification and base resources to include all general
  availability endpoints.
- Changed ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` and ``civis.io.civis_to_file`` to allow
  strings for paths to local files in addition to just file/buffer objects.

### Fixed
- Fixed parsing of multiword endpoints. Parsing no longer removes underscores
  in endpoint names.
- In ``civis.futures.ContainerFuture``, return ``False`` when users attempt to cancel
  an already-completed job. Previously, the object would sometimes give a ``CivisAPIError``
  with a 404 status code. This fix affects the executors and joblib backend, which
  use the ``ContainerFuture``.
- Tell ``flake8`` to ignore a broad except in a ``CivisFuture`` callback.
- Close open sockets (in both the ``APIClient`` and ``CivisFuture``)  when they're no
  longer needed, so as to not use more system file handles than necessary (#173).
- Correct treatment of ``FileNotFoundError`` in Python 2 (#176).
- Fixed parsing of endpoints containing hyphens.  Hyphens are replaced with
  underscores.
- Use ``civis.compat.TemporaryDirectory`` in ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` to be
  compatible with Python 2.7
- Catch notifications sent up to 30 seconds before the ``CivisFuture`` connects.
  Fixes a bug where we would sometimes miss an immediate error on SQL scripts (#174).

### Added
- Documentation updated to include new CivisML features (#137).
- ``civis.resources.cache_api_spec`` function to make it easier to record the
  current API spec locally (#141).
- Autospecced mock of the ``APIClient`` for use in testing third-party code which
  uses this library (#141).
- Added `etl`, `n_jobs`, and `validation_data` arguments to
  ModelPipeline.train (#139).
- Added `cpu`, `memory`, and `disk` arguments to ModelPipeline.predict
  (#139).
- Added ``remote_backend`` keyword to the ``civis.parallel.make_backend_factory``
  and ``civis.parallel.infer_backend_factory`` in order to set the joblib
  backend in the container for nested calls to ``joblib.Parallel``.
- Added the PyPI trove classifiers for Python 3.4 and 3.6 (#152).
- ``civis.io.civis_file_to_table`` function to import an existing Civis file
  to a table
- ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` function will now automatically retry uploads to
  the Civis Platform up to 5 times if is there is an HTTPError, ConnectionError
  or ConnectionTimeout
- Additional documentation about the use case for the Civis joblib backend.
- Added a note about serializing ``ModelPipeline`` ``APIClient`` objects to the docstring.
- Added `civis notebooks download` command-line interface command to facilitate
  downloading notebooks.

### Performance Enhancements
- ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` now takes advantage of multipart uploads to chunk
  files and perform I/O in parallel
- ``civis.io.civis_to_csv`` and ``civis.io.read_civis_sql`` will always request
  data with gzip compression to reduce I/O. Also, they will attempt to fetch
  headers in a separate query so that data can be unloaded in parallel
- ``civis.io.civis_to_csv`` with ``compression='gzip'`` currently returns a file
  with no compression. In a future release, ``compression='gzip'`` will return a
  gzip compressed file.

## 1.6.2 - 2017-09-08
### Changed
- Added explanatory text to CivisML_parallel_training.ipynb (#126).

### Fixed
- Added `ResourceWarning` for Python 2.7 (#128).
- Added `TypeError` for multi-indexed dataframes when used as input to
  CivisML (#131).
- ``ModelPipeline.from_existing`` will warn if users attempt to recreate
  a model trained with a newer version of CivisML, and fall back on the
  most recent prediction template it knows of (#134).
- Make the `PaginatedResponse` returned by LIST endpoints a full iterator.
  This also makes the `iterator=True` parameter work in Python 2.
- When using ``civis.io.civis_to_csv``, emit a warning on SQL queries which
  return no results instead of allowing a cryptic ``IndexError`` to surface (#135).
- Fixed the example code snippet for ``civis.io.civis_to_multifile_csv``.
  Also provided more details on its return dict in the docstring.
- Pinned down `sphinx_rtd_theme` and `numpydoc` in `dev-requirements.txt`
  for building the documentation.

### Added
- Jupyter notebook with demonstrations of use patterns and abstractions in the Python API client (#127).

## 1.6.1 - 2017-08-22
### Changed
- Catch unnecessary warning while importing xgboost in CivisML_parallel_training.ipynb (#121)

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where instantiating a new model via ``ModelPipeline.from_existing`` from an existing model with empty "PARAMS" and "CV_PARAMS" boxes fails (#122).
- Users can now access the ``ml`` and ``parallel`` namespaces from the base ``civis`` namespace (#123).
- Parameters in the Civis API documentation now display in the proper order (#124).

## 1.6.0 - 2017-07-27
### Changed
- Edited example for safer null value handling
- Make ``pubnub`` and ``joblib`` hard dependencies instead of optional dependencies (#110).
- Retry network errors and wait for API rate limit refresh when using the CLI (#117).
- The CLI now provides a User-Agent header which starts with "civis-cli" (#117)
- Include ``pandas`` and ``sklearn``-dependent code in Travis CI tests.

### Added
- Version 1.1 of CivisML, with custom dependency installation from remote git hosting services (i.e., Github, Bitbucket).
- Added email notifications option to ``ModelPipeline``.
- Added custom ``joblib`` backend for multiprocessing in the Civis Platform. Public-facing functions are ``make_backend_factory``, ``make_backend_template_factory``, and ``infer_backend_factory``. Includes a new hard dependency on ``cloudpickle`` to facilitate code transport.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the version of a dependency for Python 2.7 usage was incorrectly specified.
- Non-seekable file-like objects can now be provided to ``civis.io.file_to_civis``. Only seekable file-like objects will be streamed.
- The ``civis.ml.ModelFuture`` no longer raises an exception if its model job is cancelled.
- The CLI's API spec cache now expires after 24 hours instead of 10 seconds.

## 1.5.2 - 2017-05-17
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where ``ModelFuture.validation_metadata`` would not source training job metadata for a ``ModelFuture`` corresponding to prediction job (#90).
- Added more locks to improve thread safety in the ``PollableResult`` and ``CivisFuture``.
- Fix issue with Python 2/3 dependency management (#89).

## 1.5.1 - 2017-05-15
### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which made the ``ModelPipeline`` unable to generate prediction jobs for models trained with v0.5 templates (#84).
- Handle the case when inputs to ``ModelFuture`` are ``numpy.int64`` (or other non-``integer`` ints) (#85).

### Changed
- Convert `README.md` (Markdown) to `README.rst` (reStructuredText).

## 1.5.0 - 2017-05-11
### Added

- Parameter ``local_api_spec`` to ``APIClient`` to allow creation of client from local cache
- Clarify ``civis.io.dataframe_to_civis`` docstring with a note about treatment of the index.
- Added functions ``civis.io.file_id_from_run_output``, ``civis.io.file_to_dataframe``, and ``civis.io.file_to_json``.
- Added ``civis.ml`` namespace with ``ModelPipeline`` interface to Civis Platform modeling capabilities.
- Added ``examples`` directory with sample ``ModelPipeline`` code from ``civis.ml``.
- Python 2.7 compatibility

### Fixed
- Corrected the defaults listed in the docstring for ``civis.io.civis_to_multifile_csv``.
- Do not allow uploading of files greater than 5GB to S3 (#58).
- Revised example code of docstring of civis_to_file to use bytes when downloading file

### Changed
- Modified retry behavior so that 413, 429, or 503 errors accompanied by a "Retry-After" header will be retried regardless of the HTTP verb used.
- Add CSV settings arguments to ``civis.io.civis_to_csv`` function.
- Refactored use of "swagger" language.  ``get_swagger_spec`` is now ``get_api_spec`` and ``parse_swagger`` is now ``parse_api_spec``.
- Modified ``CivisFuture`` so if PubNub is disconnected, it will fall back to polling on a shorter interval.

## 1.4.0 - 2017-03-17
### API Changes
- Deprecate ``api_key`` input to higher-level functions and classes in favor of an ``APIClient`` input. The ``api_key`` will be removed in v2.0.0. (#46)

### Fixed
- Improved threading implementation in ``PollableResult`` so that it no longer blocks interpreter shutdown.
- Allow the base url of the API to be configured through the ``CIVIS_API_ENDPOINT`` environment variable. (#43)

### Added
- Decorator function for deprecating parameters (#46)

## 1.3.0 - 2017-03-07
### Added
- `civis.futures.CivisFuture` for tracking future results

### Performance Enhancements
- ``civis.io.file_to_civis`` will perform a streaming upload to Platform if the optional ``requests-toolbelt`` package is installed.
- Replace all ``PollableResult`` return values with ``CivisFuture`` to reduce the number of API calls and increase speed

## 1.2.0 - 2017-02-08
### Added
- support for multifile csv exports
- support for subscription based polling

### Changed
- civis.io functions use the "hidden" API option to keep jobs out of the UI. Deprecate the "archive" parameter in favor of "hidden".

- expose `poller` and `poller_args` as public attributes in `PollableResults`
- update to  `default_credential` to handle pagination in `credentials.list` endpoint.

### Fixed
